## About The Project

- I wanted to practice handling API and networking using generic's.
- There is bar button item's that lead you to different view's characters, films, starships etc.
- You can also choose any item in the table view to show detail of that item.

### Improvments I Want

- Every view is same (codewise). For now i don't know how to make a generic view. When I leran how to do it I'll be change those view's.
